Machine Condition Monitoring using Bearing Vibration Data

1st commit is made on NASA bearing data set in which KMeans performs fairly well on one of the unlabelled datase. Need to test AutoEncoder network on same
2nd commit is superwised learning on "The Federal University of Rio de Janeiro or University of Brazil"  dataset link http://www02.smt.ufrj.br/~offshore/mfs/page_01.html. Only three classes out of given data were processed in a NN based classifier.
